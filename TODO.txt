=================R2 NEED===============
clean up source code (for GitHub)

----Ongoing----
test using both mainBundle and Application Support Directory
keep an eye on making sure live update actually works
keep an eye on twitter widget
do testing on device
currently, update bar is at production case (i.e. dropbox _site.zip has version = 2, for app review)
test: wolf's improvements to the unzipping process
http://www.federaltransparency.gov/funded/Sandy/Pages/Sandy-Award.aspx

----QuestionsForWolfandVictoria----
what is best way to handle failed downloads? for now just jumping out of the fetch (return;)
should we allow autorotation? (note dumb bug with switching tabs while in landscape)

design of the info view?
improving looks of the program page? (lists/bullets?)

=================NICE================
get higher quality images for partner logos? http://stackoverflow.com/a/4949923/2284713
left two tab bar icons could be yet smaller, and clearer/higher res?

Tweet: Prefill with current session
Attendee networking (attendee list, detail, add to contacts, mail)
Add more information for user if uiwebview fails 
=================DONE=================
add sync bar
twitter: get from twitter dev site, the actual iframe or whatever (eventually right into Jekyll folder)
crashlytics, then testflight //installed, shared with V/Wolf
add crasher //used crashlytics recommendations for simulating crashes. perfect.
handle URLs out to safari (e.g. bill franks URL) //got simple version, can still improve by opening in webview
just opening http/https differently is tricky due to twitter -- could hack it (twitter widget does troublesome redirects)
sizing for twitter widget. can do conditionally?
fix autorotation (see code for WebViewController) -- allow horizontal only for WebViewController
add forward/backward buttons on WebViewController?
clean up twitter widget (V's recommendations?) https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines#customization //done by V
give WebViewController a better name?
tab bar titles
basic app icon
fix white flash (uiwebviews)
final tab bar icons
color behind UIViews (currently black)? (ask V)
add tweeting / iOS 6 / Tweeting capabilities //kind of included with widget
add outlets=nil to viewdidunload?
improve load of Tweets tab? so it doesn't display "Tweets about #opendata" link first? //doesn't seem to be displaying anymore //fixed along with V's aesthetic update and whiteflash fix
add currentVersion to NSUserDefaults //better yet, implement jwr's recommendations
make sure we don't try to grab from a location while it's still downloading (how do we safeguard against?) //try to make sure file is there before switching bundles
add bogus little test for internal linking
self.basedirectorytouse should probably be an NSUserDefault (so consistent across all DTCVCs and subclasses) //unless perhaps... it shouldn't be consistent, and is fresh for every DTCVC/subclass. Maybe need to do AppSuppDir check for internals, too. maybe self.basedirectorytouse shouldn't even be a class property... just a method var could work? //correct
add handling in case no data from dropbox public folder (at any time) -- to avoid crashes if error downloading
add UINetworkActivityIndicator
fancy go forward/back buttons
why require clean and rebuild in order to see updated Application Support Directory files (or does this also apply to mainBundle as well)? test that live update actually works //seems to work...
add test2, for another bread crumb test
FIX THE TITLE, ARGH
make title bar dynamic
fix color/duration of sync bar
maybe add uiactivitynotification for updates/dropbox calls, too
do we want uiactivitynotification on loading Twitter tab?
fix urls in speaker bios //fixed by V
issue: News/other tab viewsDoLoad, then the download/unzip happens... but don't get update, because not reloading. Perhaps need to blast a setNeedsDisplay out, or just webview reload //actually, use NSNotification
also make title bar have static value, in case webview (twitter) doesn't load?
do we want to (can we?) add the sync bar not to the DTCVCs but to the actual tab bar? //done
check consistency (with mainBundle) of jekyll run phase build script -- sometimes have to delete app and rebuild? why? //seems to be fixed -- caused by failure to update uiwebview after load
updating news tab for press releases //done as of 8-20
maybe need to recreate twitter widget, which is still showing #opendata tweets
program enrollment - make sure I know how to clear credentials and add new
maybe have the sync bar start up earlier in fetch process //probably not -- checking for needUpdate is probably better invisible
avoid black flash?
add message, icon on fifth tab
asynchronous syncing (add method/class)
header/detail relationships for speakers, sessions, etc.
possibly make storyboard more efficient, without messing up nav bar titles (only after we have more file:// URLs)
add logos for partner sponsors, under orange heading (bottom of News page). maybe link to partners page
add a line break for sponsors area
review maps links (why not .app?) <<<<this is probably because it's opening in external web view -- we need to suppress the normal external web view if the URL starts with maps.apple.com
doesn't always update news tab? is nsnotification not working? //seems like just webview reload isn't good enough
splash screen
add URLs pointing from program to individual speakers
figure out the 403 on the map tab (or kaibosh) //got custom error page to show up if 403
when submitting: improve keywords
get white background for sponsors on news page //done by V
when fixed on website, update URLs for Senator Warner

=================WATCH=================
stupid crash bug (when clicking on links in uiwebview that is displaying a pdf, as on our news page):  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16080374/uiwebview-pdf-hyperlinks-crash
    update: supposedly will be fixed soon (radar filed) https://twitter.com/aSx_edoc/status/362940341965426689
    lame solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808267/uiwebview-how-to-disable-action-sheets-uiactionsheet
    or: http://sugartin.info/2012/10/25/avoiddisable-default-actionsheet-for-opencopy-from-a-uiwebview/

twitter view's fit (see tweet box and title in one view) //setting "nofooter" will do for now
