<p><img src="earl-e-devaney.jpg" alt="Photo of Earl E. Devaney"> <b>Hon. Earl E. Devaney</b> is the President of The Devaney Group, having retired from the Federal government, with over 41 years of service, at the end of 2011. He now provides strategic advice to a wide variety of companies seeking to establish, mature, and expand business with the Federal government. Mr. Devaney is recognized for wide-ranging start-up and turnaround expertise within the complexity of government. He is a decisive, independent thinker with policy and operations management expertise and the ability to assess issues and respond to organizational crises. Providing lasting solutions that streamline operations and increase return on investment are hallmarks of his career.</p>

<p>Six days after President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law, he named Mr. Devaney Chairman of Recovery and Transparency Board, to oversee the $840B stimulus expenditure. In announcing his appointment, the President said, “I can’t think of any more tenacious and efficient guardian of the hard-earned tax dollars the American peoplehave entrusted us to wisely invest.”</p>

<p>Working under tight legislative deadlines and maximizing his interpersonal skills, Mr. Devaney established a new Federal Agency, created two award winning websites with innovative geospatial web services for full transparency, and implemented an internationally lauded oversight program. These achievements were accompanied by extensive liaison at the highest levels of government, frequent Congressional testimony, and an active calendar of speaking and media engagements. Reporting directly to the Vice President, he also served as the Co-Chair of the U.S. Attorney General’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. His leadership of the Recovery Board resulted in extraordinarily low levels of fraud while enabling millions of citizens to clearly see how their tax dollars were being spent in real time via the Internet.</p>

<p>Mr. Devaney was heralded by the national media for ushering in a new era of accountability and transparency for the Federal government. In 2010, he addressed the European Parliament, in Brussels, on “Accountability and Transparency: The American Experiment”. In 2011, he received the Donald L. Scantlebury Award, which recognizes a senior government executive who demonstrates outstanding leadership and significant economies, efficiencies and improvements in financial management in the public sector.</p>

<p>In 1999, Mr. Devaney was appointed Inspector General for the Department of the Interior by President Clinton and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. During his tenure, he led the public corruption investigations, resulting in the convictions of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the Department’s Deputy Secretary and presided over the oil and gas investigations that engulfed the Mineral Management Service. Due to his investigative and audit work at Interior, Mr. Devaney was invited to deliver the keynote address at the 2008 United Nations Conference on Public Corruption in Vienna. Also in 2008, Ethisphere Magazine named him one of the top 100 most influential people in business ethics.</p>

<p>Prior to his role at Interior, he was the Director of the Office of Criminal Enforcement, Forensics and Training for the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Devaney directed all of EPA’s criminal investigators, as well as the agency’s forensics laboratory and its enforcement-training institute. He built and led these programs from inception through unprecedented growth. While at EPA he was the U.S. Head of Delegation and Co-Chair of INTERPOL’s Environmental Crimes Committee in Lyon, France. In 1998, he received the Presidential Rank Award for Outstanding Government Service.</p>

<p>Mr. Devaney spent the first 20 years of his career with the Secret Service serving in locations throughout the United States and abroad. When he retired, he was the Service’s foremost expert on fraud and Special Agent-in-Charge of the Fraud Division. He modernized worldwide fraud programs by introducing progressive, new approaches to investigating and preventing credit card, telecommunications, and computer fraud.</p>

<p>Mr. Devaney holds a B.A. from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and graduated from the prestigious Leadership Coaching Program at Georgetown University, the Executive Development Program at George Washington University, and two executive management programs at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. In 2011, he was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. Currently he serves on a number of corporate and non- profit Boards. </p>
