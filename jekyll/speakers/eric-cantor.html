<p><img src="eric-cantor.jpg"><b>Rep. Eric Cantor</b> is a results-oriented leader in Congress who is committed to helping solve problems for America's families. He has developed a broad range of innovative solutions to promote free markets, economic growth, job creation and national security.</p>
<p>Representing Virginia's 7th District, Eric has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2001. Eric was elected by his colleagues in the House to serve as the Majority Leader for the 112th and 113th Congresses.</p>
<p>In Congress, Eric has earned a reputation as a strategic thinker and ideas-driven conservative. The Weekly Standard featured him as an emerging leader among an impressive group of "Young Guns of the House GOP." Congressional Quarterly has described him as "the GOP's communicator, rainmaker and consensus builder."</p>
<p>A former small businessman, Eric has emerged as a leading voice on the economy and job creation. His commentary is often featured in publications focusing on a wide range of issues including economic matters, health care and foreign policy. A proponent of a strong national defense, Eric formerly chaired the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare and remains committed to providing our nation's military and intelligence communities with the resources they need to keep the homeland safe.</p>
<p>In Congress, Eric has worked to lower taxes, eliminate excessive regulation, strengthen small businesses, and encourage entrepreneurship. He was the chief sponsor of a 2006 bill to make permanent the slashed individual income tax rates for capital gains and dividends, rewarding entrepreneurs, retirees and investors with the ability to create more opportunity for their families and jobs for our communities. He has long been a key player in health care, fighting for greater choice for families. He authored the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which made it easier for families to save for their health care needs through Health Savings Accounts. The legislation became law in late 2006.</p>
<p>As Minority Whip, Eric assembled a highly effective and energetic Republican whip team that served as the nerve center of the Republican Conference. In early 2009, the whip team coordinated the effort in which no Republicans voted for the nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill.</p>
<p>During the lead-up to the stimulus vote, then-Minority Leader John Boehner tapped Eric to head up the Republican Economic Solutions Group that produced the Republican alternative economic plan which would have created twice the jobs at half the cost of the stimulus bill signed into law. The group continued to develop and produce responsible solutions to a broad range of challenges, offering a window into GOP leadership in the 112th Congress. In December 2009, the group offered President Obama a no-cost jobs plan.</p>
<p>Eric also co-authored the New York Times best-selling book, Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders, with Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Paul Ryan.</p>
<p>Eric is a lifelong resident of the Richmond area, where he got his start in politics as a driver for his predecessor Congressman Tom Bliley. Eric received his undergraduate degree from The George Washington University, his law degree from The College of William and Mary, and his master's degree from Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p>Eric and his wife, Diana, reside in Richmond, Virginia. They have three children: Evan, a recent graduate of The University of Virginia; Jenna, a rising senior at the University of Michigan; and Michael, who is in his second year at The University of Virginia.</p>
