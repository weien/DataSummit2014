In this capacity, Castle oversees water and science policy for the Department and has responsibility for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>
<p>Castle spearheaded the Department of the Interior’s WaterSMART program, which provides federal leadership on the path toward sustainable water supplies.  She was the driving force behind the 2010 Memorandum of Understanding among Interior, the Department of Energy, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers addressing the development of sustainable hydropower generation.  She has been a champion of the National Land Imaging Program, the nation’s longest sequential moderate-resolution satellite imaging program provided by the Landsat series of satellites, now hosted by USGS.  Castle also provides hands-on leadership on Colorado River issues and is the Secretary’s designee to, and Chair of, the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Work Group.</p>
<p>Before joining Interior, Castle practiced law for 28 years in Denver, Colorado with the Rocky Mountain based law firm of Holland & Hart LLP, specializing in water issues.  She was elected in 2001 to chair the law firm’s management committee and served in that position until 2004. She also chaired the firm’s natural resources law department.</p>
<p>In 2007 Colorado Governor Bill Ritter appointed Castle to the South Platte River Basin Task Force, which examined the water crisis in this northeastern Colorado basin, and its challenges for water users and provided recommendations for legislative changes that continue to be explored. She also was the chair and an elected member of the Board of Directors of the Genesee Water and Sanitation District from 1989 to 2002. Castle was twice appointed to the Colorado Ground Water Commission by former Colorado Governor Roy Romer and served from 1994 to 2002.</p>
<p>During her legal career, Castle was continually involved in organizations providing legal representation to those who could not afford to pay. She served on the board of Colorado Legal Services for over 25 years, and was on the board of the Colorado Legal Aid Foundation and the Colorado Lawyer Trust Account Foundation for many years. The Women’s Vision Foundation selected Castle for its prestigious Woman of Vision award in 2008, recognizing positive, enlightened leadership and active promotion of the advancement of women within the law firm and in the community.</p>
<p>Castle received a Bachelor of Science degree in applied mathematics, with honors, from the University of Colorado, College of Engineering, in 1973. Her J.D. in 1981 was also from the University of Colorado where she was Order of the Coif.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Reclamation manages, develops, and protects water and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner in the interest of the American public. Reclamation is the largest provider of water in the country, bringing water to more than 31 million people in the seventeen western states, and is the second largest producer of hydroelectric power. USGS is a world leader in the natural sciences and provides reliable scientific information in support of the management of resources, minimization of loss of life and property from natural disasters, and enhancing and protecting quality of life.</p>
