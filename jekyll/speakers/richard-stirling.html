<p><img src="richard-stirling.jpg">Since 2008, <strong>Richard Stirling</strong> has been at the heart of Transparency and open data initiatives in the UK. Within Government, Richard helped shape the current Transparency agenda, created </span><a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a><span> and the world's first online competition for government data, <a href="http://www.showusabetterway.com">www.showusabetterway.com</a>.</p>

<p>Richard is passionate about the ability for technology to change society and the possibilities it opens up for new businesses models. He provided the first seed funding for the Open Knowledge Foundation's Where Does My Money Go? in 2008 which has gone on to become Open Spending and worked with the Ordnance Survey on OpenSpace and their business approach to Open Data in 2009. In 2010 he made sure all of the commitments in the Prime Minister's letter on Transparency were met and the UK was able to cement its position as a world leader in open data.</p>

<p>Originally a lawyer, before his work on Transparency Richard has had a number of roles in HM Treasury working on corporate tax and financial services.</p>
